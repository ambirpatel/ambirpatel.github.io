    • Trained an intelligent agent that draws bounding boxes around an object in the image. This implementation combines CNN, DQN, and SVM to detect an object in an image.
    
    • The algorithm extract features from CNN which are fed to DQN to train an agent to localize the object and this localized object is categorized using the SVM model.
